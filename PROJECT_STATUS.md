# Project Status: Transportation Tracking System

## Overview
This is a comprehensive bus rider tracking application that enhances urban transportation through intelligent, role-based authentication and user-centric design.

## Current State
The application has most features implemented but is experiencing issues with the QR scanner functionality in the driver check-in page.

## Key Files
- `public/driver-checkin.html` - Contains the QR scanner implementation that needs fixing
- `public/js/qr-scanner.js` - External QR scanner script
- `server/routes.ts` - Backend API endpoints including `/api/trips` for employee check-ins
- `public/js/driver-checkin.js` - Driver check-in/check-out functionality

## Main Issues
1. **QR Scanner Functionality**: The QR scanner on the driver-checkin.html page is not working properly. The scanner and employee check-in system need to be fixed.
2. **Driver Check-in Integration**: There's a conflict between the driver check-in status and the QR scanner activation.

## Authentication
- Admin account: username "admin" with password "admin123"
- No other accounts are in the clean database

## Database Details
- Database is PostgreSQL hosted on Neon
- Connection string is in the DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Database schema is defined in `shared/schema.ts`

## Recent Changes
- Fixed API endpoint for employee check-ins from `/api/direct-trips` to `/api/trips`
- Temporarily disabled driver check-in requirement to ensure scanning works
- Simplified the scanner code to avoid previous conflicts
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Export Notes
When exporting to a different development environment:
1. Ensure all files are copied, especially the HTML/JS files in the public directory
2. PostgreSQL database will need to be set up with the schema in `shared/schema.ts`
3. Node.js dependencies need to be installed (see package.json)
